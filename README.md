# Empathy Evaluation of Large Language Models

This repository contains the code for the evaluation framework implemented to evaluate the empathetic quality of responses generated by Large Language Models (LLMs) when responding to day-to-day positive and negative emotions. 

The repository also contains the data generated by a between-groups study evaluating the responses generated by humans and two variants of ChatGPT (powered by GPT-4).

The study details can be found in the paper "Is ChatGPT More Empathetic than Humans?"
